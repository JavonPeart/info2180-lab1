 <h2>Javon Peart</h2>
 <p>Hello World! I am a final year Computer Science student at the University of the West Indies Mona. My passion for computing
    started in high-school, and there, I was able to participate in a Robotics team that managed to place first in the 2019 competition
    known as the FIRST Tech Challenge. Now, I intend to achieve a bachelors degree in Computer Science by 2023 and hone my craft 
    by working in the Technology Industry of Jamaica. I have great interest in INFO2180 as web development is an important skill to 
    have as a Computer Scientist.
